### 6,Folder structure.
|--3D file： Contains 3D model files (.stp) for the hardware. These files can be used for visualization, enclosure design, or integration into CAD software.

|--Datasheet: Includes datasheets for components used in the project, providing detailed specifications, electrical characteristics, and pin configurations.

|--Eagle_SCH&PCB: Contains **Eagle CAD** schematic (`.sch`) and PCB layout (`.brd`) files. These are used for circuit design and PCB manufacturing.

|--example: Provides example code and projects to demonstrate how to use the hardware and libraries. These examples help users get started quickly.

|--factory_firmware: Stores pre-compiled factory firmware that can be directly flashed onto the device. This ensures the device runs the default functionality.

|--factory_sourcecode:  Contains the source code for the factory firmware, allowing users to modify and rebuild the firmware as needed.

|--libraries: Includes necessary libraries required for compiling and running the project. These libraries provide drivers and additional functionalities for the hardware.
